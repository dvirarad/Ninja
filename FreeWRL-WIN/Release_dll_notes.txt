There are 3 ways to distribute system dlls to target computers:
1. using vcredist_x86.exe for your VC version (or ia64 or x64) - running it on the target computer
2. using merge modules in deployment projects
3. put the .dlls directly in your application folder

freewrl win32 as of:
August 10, 2011 - we use method 3 -dlls in applicaiton folder- as follows:
- dllfreewrl.dll - VC90 dlls, gdiplus.dll (built with vs2008 express edition)
- freeWRL.exe - VC90 dlls
- js32.dll VC90
- pthreadsVC2.dll VC90
- freeWRLAx.ocx - VC71 dlls (built with vs2003 standard edition)

This means if you use a different VisualStudio/VisualC++ edition, you need to get the appropriate version of the system dlls.
If you have problems it may show up as so called SidebySide (Sxs) issues:

however you don't need to rely on any Sxs if you get all the right system dlls in your application folder.
Depends.exe http://www.dependencywalker.com/ can also be used to check the list of dlls your exe/ocx/dll is dependent on.
Computer > Administrative Tools > Event Viewer can also show more detail - which dll wasn't found
